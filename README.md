# ChainTracker 15 (2014 - 2016)

ChainTracker is a traceability collection and analysis environment that enables developers to explore the static and dynamic aspects of model-to-model, and model-to-text transformations. ChainTracker reasons about the symbolic execution of model transformations when used in isolation, or when composed in model-transformation chains. The analysis environment provides interactive visualizations and smart transformation editors that help developers to navigate its architecture and execution mechanics.

ChainTracker has been developed by Victor Guana at the University of Alberta in the Service Systems Research Group, and it aims at making model-driven software development more accesible to the general software engineering community. ChainTracker helps developers debugging, testing and maintaining model transformations by providing an integrated development environment that infers, quantifies, and visualizes their execution semantics.
